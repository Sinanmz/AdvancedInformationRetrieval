However, upon discovering that the women are secretly poisoning the mother-in-law and the husband, the legal owners of the farm, István must make the most difficult decision of his life. As a personal war is waging within his own consciousness over morality and self-preservation, István must decide whether to remain silent about the women's devious secret and preserve his own life, or to report their heinous crime to the Royal Gendarme, which would also mean certain death for him.—21st Century DreamQuest Films Ltd"

This success was not foreseeable at first, because at the time of its release the film was a flop at the box office. The world of the Blade Runner is oppressively topical today. In his cult film, Ridley Scott conjures up a cold, rain-lashed, neon-glowing big city moloch who plunges into a social, economic and environmental dystopia. Today problems such as climate change, surveillance, overpowering corporations and artificial intelligence are more present than ever and the streets are populated with homeless people between high-rise buildings. Since Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", there has not been a science fiction film that, thanks to its production design and special effects, has developed such a visual impact as ""Blade Runner"". All the more astonishing were the commercial failure and the press disaster that the film experienced when it opened in theaters. How the film nevertheless managed to become one of the most influential science fiction films of all time, this documentary tells viewers using behind-the-scenes material from various sets, photos, original locations in Los Angeles and illuminating interviewees with those involved in the unforgettable Film production."
